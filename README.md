# JS_Calculator

Simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide and do modulo operands.

Known issues:
 - using multiple operands in success doesn't compute -> Nothing happens, so that's fine
 - Layout, visuals etc. are not final -> Will work on them later
 - Rounding errors cause loss of accuracy and at worst cause. eg: 100/3 = 33.333333 => 33.33333333*3 = 99
